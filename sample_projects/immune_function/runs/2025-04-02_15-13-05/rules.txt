Cell Hypothesis Rules

In tumor cell cells:
damage increases apoptosis
apoptotic increases apoptotic debris secretion
necrotic increases necrotic debris secretion
time decreases damage repair rate

In macrophage cells:

In fast T cell cells:
damage delivered increases transform to exhausted T cell

In slow T cell cells:

In effector T cell cells:

In exhausted T cell cells:
