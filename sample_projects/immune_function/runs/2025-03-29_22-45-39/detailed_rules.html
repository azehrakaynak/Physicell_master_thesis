<body><h1>Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)</h1>
<p>In tumor cell cells:
<ul>
<li>damage increases apoptosis from 0 towards 9e+09 with a Hill response, with half-max 30 and Hill power 100.</li>
<li>apoptotic increases apoptotic debris secretion from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10. Rule applies to dead cells.</li>
<li>necrotic increases necrotic debris secretion from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10. Rule applies to dead cells.</li>
<li>time decreases damage repair rate from 0.1 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 15 and Hill power 10.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In macrophage cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In fast T cell cells:
<ul>
<li>damage delivered increases transform to exhausted T cell from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 30 and Hill power 8.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In slow T cell cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In effector T cell cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In exhausted T cell cells:
