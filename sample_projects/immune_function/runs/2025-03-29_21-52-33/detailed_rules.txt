Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)

In tumor cell cells:
damage increases apoptosis from 0 towards 9e+09 with a Hill response, with half-max 30 and Hill power 100.
apoptotic increases apoptotic debris secretion from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10. Rule applies to dead cells.
necrotic increases necrotic debris secretion from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10. Rule applies to dead cells.
time decreases damage repair rate from 0.1 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 15 and Hill power 10.

In macrophage cells:

In fast T cell cells:
damage delivered increases transform to exhausted T cell from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 30 and Hill power 8.

In slow T cell cells:

In effector T cell cells:

In exhausted T cell cells:
